## Introduction
In modern smart homes, voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home serve multiple family members but treat everyone the same way. Our project aims to build a **Speaker-Adaptive Voice Assistant (SAVA)** that recognizes who is speaking, understands the context of commands, and delivers **personalized responses embedded with strong privacy protections**. The system identifies the speaker, determines their location in the house, and enforces role-based access control. It also processes audio **locally on the device** to protect user privacy.

The system resolves the commands intelligently based on **priority rules and predefined permissions**. Our goal is to create a voice assistant that genuinely understands and adapts to each family member, improving safety, convenience, and personalization in smart home environments.

## Main Features
- **Speaker Recognition** — Identifies individual users using voice recognition function
-  **Location Recognition** — Determines which room commands originate from
-  **On-Device Processing** — Protects privacy and prevents data leakage
-  **Role Assignment** — Different access for parents, children, and guests
-  **Conflict Resolution** — Deals with overlapping commands using priority rules
-  **Smart Home Control** — Lights, TV, door control, etc
