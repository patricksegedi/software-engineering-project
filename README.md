## Introduction
Smart home assistants, such as Alexa and Google Home, have become genuinely useful parts of our daily lives. But even at their best, they have a major limitation: they treat everyone in the house exactly the same. They do not know if you are a parent, a child, or a guest.

We believe these assistants can be more than **just smart** -they should be personal. Our project, Smart**ER** Speaker, is designed to recognize who is speaking and adjust its behavior accordingly. It uses local processing to distinguish family members and provide them a personalized experience or even enforce safety rules - like preventing a child from turning on the TV in the middle of the night - all while keeping your private conversations inside the home, not in the cloud.

Our goal is to create a voice assistant that genuinely understands and adapts to each family member, enhancing the safety, convenience, and personalization of the smart home experience.
