# SmartER Speaker - Speaker-Adaptive Voice 

## 📌 Overview
Modern smart homes typically rely on cloud-based voice assistants such as Alexa or Google Home, but they treat every household member the same. Our project aims to build a **Speaker-Adaptive Voice Assistant (SAVA)** that recognizes who is speaking, understands the context of commands, and delivers **personalized responses embedded with strong privacy protections**. The system identifies the speaker, determines their location in the house, and enforces role-based access control (e.g., parent vs. child), all while processing audio **locally on the device** to protect user privacy.

When multiple users give conflicting commands, the system resolves them intelligently based on **priority rules and predefined permissions**. Our goal is to create a voice assistant that genuinely understands and adapts to each family member, improving safety, convenience, and personalization in smart home environments.
